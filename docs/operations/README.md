### Writing Principles

**1. Clear and Actionable**

- Avoid jargon unless commonly understood by the team

**2. Consistent Structure**
Every runbook follows this template:
- **Purpose and Overview** - Why this exists, when to use it
- **Prerequisites** - What must be true before starting
- **Step-by-step Instructions** - Numbered procedures with commands
- **Expected Outcomes** - What success looks like
- **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and fixes
- **Escalation Procedures** - When and how to escalate

**3. Include Context and Rationale**
- Explain why procedures exist and their business impact
- Describe risks and consequences of actions
- Provide background on system behavior

**4. Comprehensive Troubleshooting**
- Document "what if" scenarios with specific fixes
- Include log file locations and sample error output
- Provide escalation decision trees

## üéØ Operational Philosophy

**"Enable confident action under pressure"**

These runbooks prioritize clarity and completeness over brevity. In production incidents, comprehensive guidance prevents errors and reduces resolution time. Every procedure should be executable by any qualified team member, even during high-stress situations.

**Living Documents**: Operations change as systems evolve. These runbooks are maintained as living documents that reflect current reality, not historical procedures.
