## 📋 Executive Summary

### Purpose & Scope
This dashboard implements institutional-grade stress testing methodologies to assess the church's SGD 3.4M investment portfolio against various crisis scenarios. The system provides quantitative risk assessment tools to support data-driven investment decisions and ensure adequate reserve coverage for operational continuity.

### Key Risk Metrics Overview
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Portfolio decline percentage under stress (threshold: 20%)
- **Reserve Coverage Ratio**: Stressed portfolio value vs. annual OPEX requirement
- **Time to Liquidity**: Weighted average days to access funds (threshold: 90 days)
- **Asset Allocation Analysis**: Post-stress portfolio composition breakdown

### Critical Business Assumptions Requiring IC Validation
- **Annual OPEX**: SGD 2,400,000 (requires confirmation vs. actual church expenses)
- **Reserve Requirement**: 12 months coverage (vs. industry standard 3-6 months)
- **Risk Thresholds**: 20% volatility breach, 90-day liquidity threshold

---

## 🔢 Risk Metrics Framework

### 2.1 Maximum Drawdown

**Definition**: Maximum portfolio value decline under stress scenarios, expressed as percentage of original portfolio value.

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
Maximum Drawdown = (Original Portfolio Value - Stressed Portfolio Value) / Original Portfolio Value
```

**Business Interpretation**:
- Measures worst-case portfolio decline in crisis scenarios
- Critical for understanding downside risk exposure
- Determines if portfolio can withstand severe market stress

**Threshold Analysis**:
- **Alert Threshold**: 20% decline triggers volatility breach flag
- **Historical Benchmarking**:
  - 2008 Financial Crisis: STI declined >50%, our modeling uses -37% (conservative)
  - COVID-19 2020: STI declined 32-34%, our modeling uses -33% (accurate)
  - Asian Financial Crisis 1997-98: Regional markets declined 40-80%

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Time Deposit interest rate sensitivity corrected from 80% to 0%

### 2.2 Reserve Coverage Ratio

**Definition**: Ratio of stressed portfolio value to annual operational expenses, indicating months of operational coverage available post-crisis.

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
Reserve Coverage Ratio = Stressed Portfolio Value / Annual OPEX
Months of Coverage = Reserve Coverage Ratio × 12 months
```

**Business Interpretation**:
- Measures operational sustainability during financial stress
- Ensures church can continue operations during market downturns
- Critical fiduciary responsibility metric for board oversight

**Industry Comparison**:
| Organization Type | Standard Reserve Coverage |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Churches/Nonprofits** | 3-6 months (industry standard) |
| **Current Setting** | 12 months (conservative approach) |
| **Endowment Funds** | 6-12 months |
| **Corporate Treasuries** | 3-6 months |

**Impact Analysis**:
- **6-month requirement**: More scenarios show "excess reserves", higher investment flexibility
- **12-month requirement**: Conservative approach, fewer scenarios show adequacy
- **SGD 2.4M OPEX assumption**: ±SGD 400K variance changes all coverage ratios by ±2 months

### 2.3 Time to Liquidity

**Definition**: Weighted average number of days required to access portfolio funds under stress conditions, including redemption freezes and early withdrawal penalties.

**Mathematical Formula**:
```
Time to Liquidity = Σ (Asset Weight × Adjusted Liquidity Period)

Where:
Asset Weight = Asset Value / Total Portfolio Value
Adjusted Liquidity Period = Base Liquidity + Redemption Freeze (for applicable assets)
```

**Detailed Calculation Example**:
```
Portfolio Composition:
- Cash (SGD 200K × 0 days) = 0
- MMF (SGD 1M × (1 day + freeze)) = 1M × (1 + 14) = 15M days
- Bonds (SGD 350K × (5 days + freeze)) = 350K × (5 + 14) = 6.65M days  
- Multi-Asset (SGD 550K × (30 days + freeze)) = 550K × (30 + 14) = 24.2M days
- Time Deposits (SGD 1.3M × 180 days) = 234M days

Total Portfolio Value = SGD 3.4M
Weighted Liquidity = (0 + 15M + 6.65M + 24.2M + 234M) / 3.4M = 82.3 days
```

**Asset-Specific Liquidity Assumptions**:
| Asset Type | Base Liquidity | Redemption Freeze Impact | Rationale |
|------------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Cash** | 0 days | No impact | Immediate access |
| **MMF** | 1-2 days | +freeze days | T+1 settlement + crisis delays |
| **Bond Funds** | 5 days | +freeze days | Fund processing + market stress |
| **Multi-Asset** | 30 days | +freeze days | Complex holdings, rebalancing needs |
| **Time Deposits** | 180-365 days | No impact | Fixed maturity contracts |

**Threshold Justification**:
- **90-day threshold**: Based on typical church cash flow cycles and seasonal variations
- **Emergency scenarios**: Major facility repairs, unexpected operational needs
- **Market conditions**: Sufficient time for markets to stabilize post-crisis

## 📈 Asset Risk Modeling

### 3.1 Risk Profile Matrix

**Comprehensive Asset Risk Parameters**:

| Asset Type | Volatility | Interest Rate Sensitivity | Liquidity (Days) | Stress Rationale |
|------------|------------|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Cash** | 0.1% | 50% | 0 | Minimal risk, moderate rate sensitivity |
| **Time Deposits** | 0.5% | **0%** | 180 | Fixed contracts unaffected by rate changes during term |
| **Money Market Funds** | 2% | 90% | 2 | High rate sensitivity, low duration risk |
| **Bond Funds** | 8% | 120% | 5 | Duration risk, credit spread sensitivity |
| **Multi-Asset Funds** | 15% | 30% | 30 | Equity exposure, diversification benefits |

**Key Modeling Corrections (August 2025)**:
- **Time Deposit Sensitivity**: Corrected from 80% to 0% (SGD 20,800 impact in extreme scenarios)
- **Early Withdrawal Logic**: Now only applies penalties when liquidity gap exists
- **Interest Rate Modeling**: Properly reflects fixed vs. variable rate characteristics

### 3.2 Stress Factor Application Methodology

**Interest Rate Shock Implementation**:
```python
# Variable Rate Assets (MMF, Cash)
Stressed Value = Original Value × (1 + Rate Shock × Sensitivity)

# Fixed Rate Assets (Time Deposits)  
Stressed Value = Original Value × (1 + 0)  # No impact during contract term

# Bond Funds (Inverse Duration Relationship)
Stressed Value = Original Value × (1 + Rate Shock × Sensitivity × -1)
```

**Multi-Asset Drawdown Modeling**:
- **Direct Application**: Portfolio value decline applied proportionally
- **Range**: -10% (mild correction) to -50% (severe bear market)
- **Historical Calibration**: Based on Singapore STI performance during crises

**Early Withdrawal Penalty Logic** ✅ **FIXED**:
```python
# Step 1: Calculate liquidity requirement
Required Liquidity = Annual OPEX Requirement

# Step 2: Assess available liquid assets  
Available Liquidity = Sum(Cash + MMF + Short-term assets ≤30 days)

# Step 3: Apply penalties only if gap exists
if Required Liquidity > Available Liquidity:
    Liquidity Gap = Required Liquidity - Available Liquidity
    Apply penalties proportionally to early withdrawal amount
else:
    No penalties applied
```

**Counterparty Risk Considerations**:
- **Implementation**: Percentage writedown applied to specific asset types
- **Scenarios**: Bank failures, fund closure, institutional default
- **Range**: 0% (no risk) to 100% (total loss) - typically 2-5% in severe scenarios

## ⚡ Stress Testing Methodology

### 4.1 Scenario Design Framework

**Conservative Scenario** (Baseline resilience test):
```yaml
Interest Rate Shock: -0.5% (mild easing)
Inflation Spike: 4% (moderate increase)
Multi-Asset Drawdown: -15% (market correction)
Redemption Freeze: 5 days (brief liquidity stress)
Early Withdrawal Penalty: -0.5% (minimal impact)
Expected Outcome: Portfolio demonstrates strong resilience
```

**Moderate Stress Scenario** (Standard risk assessment):
```yaml
Interest Rate Shock: -1.5% (significant easing)
Inflation Spike: 6% (elevated inflation)
Multi-Asset Drawdown: -25% (bear market territory)
Redemption Freeze: 15 days (extended liquidity stress)
Early Withdrawal Penalty: -1.5% (meaningful cost)
Expected Outcome: Adequate reserves with some strain
```

**Severe Crisis Scenario** (Maximum stress test):
```yaml
Interest Rate Shock: -2% (zero bound scenario)
Inflation Spike: 8% (high inflation crisis)
Multi-Asset Drawdown: -40% (severe bear market)
Redemption Freeze: 30 days (systemic liquidity crisis)
Early Withdrawal Penalty: -2.5% (high early exit cost)
Expected Outcome: Minimum acceptable reserve levels
```

**Historical Scenario Validation**:

**2008 Financial Crisis Replication**:
- **Market Decline**: -37% (calibrated to Singapore experience)
- **Interest Environment**: -2% shock (emergency rate cuts)
- **Liquidity Stress**: 21-day freeze (institutional funding crisis)
- **Validation**: Singapore survived with adequate reserves, model should reflect this

**COVID-19 Scenario (March 2020)**:
- **Market Decline**: -33% (actual STI performance)
- **Interest Environment**: -1.5% (policy response)
- **Liquidity Stress**: 14-day freeze (brief institutional stress)
- **Validation**: Rapid recovery, model appropriately conservative

### 4.2 Calculation Sequence & Quality Assurance

**Step-by-Step Stress Application Process**:

1. **Portfolio Baseline Establishment**:
   ```
   Original Portfolio Value = Σ(Asset Amounts)
   Original Asset Allocation = Each Asset / Total Portfolio
   ```

2. **Asset-Specific Stress Application**:
   ```
   For each asset type:
     Apply interest rate shock (if applicable)
     Apply multi-asset drawdown (if applicable)  
     Apply counterparty risk (if applicable)
     Ensure non-negative values
   ```

3. **Liquidity Gap Analysis & Early Withdrawal Penalties**:
   ```
   Calculate total liquidity requirement
   Assess available liquid assets
   Apply early withdrawal penalties only if gap exists
   ```

4. **Risk Metric Computation**:
   ```
   Maximum Drawdown = (Original - Stressed) / Original
   Reserve Coverage = Stressed Value / Annual OPEX
   Time to Liquidity = Weighted average calculation
   ```

5. **Quality Assurance Checks**:
   ```
   Verify all calculations sum correctly
   Check for data type consistency
   Validate stress factors within acceptable ranges
   Confirm breach flags trigger appropriately
   ```

**Model Validation Results**:
- **Mathematical Consistency**: All formulas validated against manual calculations
- **Historical Accuracy**: Stress scenarios align with actual Singapore market events
- **Edge Case Testing**: System handles extreme parameters without errors
- **Data Integrity**: Real market data integration validated (STI, SORA rates, currency)

### 4.3 Correlation & Independence Assumptions

**Current Implementation** (Independent Factors):
```
Total Stress = Interest Rate Impact + Multi-Asset Impact + Liquidity Impact
```

**Known Limitations**:
- **Independence Assumption**: All stress factors applied separately
- **Reality**: Interest rates and asset prices correlate negatively during crises
- **Future Enhancement**: Correlation modeling under development

**Typical Crisis Correlations**:
| Factor Pair | Normal Markets | Crisis Markets | Current Model |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Rates vs Equity** | Low (-0.2) | High (-0.7) | Independent |
| **Liquidity vs Volatility** | Low (0.3) | High (0.8) | Independent |
| **Regional vs Global** | Moderate (0.6) | High (0.9) | Independent |

**Impact Assessment**: Current independence assumption is **conservative** - actual crisis scenarios may be less severe due to policy coordination and correlation benefits.

## ⚠️ Model Limitations & Considerations

### Known Limitations

**1. Independence Assumption**:
- **Issue**: All stress factors applied independently
- **Reality**: Crisis scenarios involve correlated factor movements
- **Impact**: Model may overestimate stress in some scenarios
- **Status**: Correlation modeling under development

**2. Static Portfolio Assumption**:
- **Issue**: No rebalancing or tactical adjustments during stress
- **Reality**: IC may adjust allocation during crisis
- **Impact**: Model shows worst-case scenario without management intervention

**3. Liquidity Modeling Limitations**:
- **Issue**: Assumes orderly markets and normal redemption processes
- **Reality**: Severe crises may involve extended market closures
- **Impact**: 90-day liquidity threshold may be optimistic in tail scenarios

**4. Point-in-Time Analysis**:
- **Issue**: Stress tests based on current portfolio composition
- **Reality**: Portfolio evolves over time with new investments/maturities
- **Impact**: Regular re-assessment required for accuracy

### Model Confidence Levels

**High Confidence Scenarios** (Conservative to Moderate):
- Market corrections up to -25%
- Interest rate movements within ±1.5%
- Short-term liquidity stress (≤14 days)
- **Validation**: Aligned with historical Singapore experience

**Medium Confidence Scenarios** (Severe Crisis):
- Market crashes -25% to -40%
- Extreme rate movements ±2%
- Extended liquidity stress (15-30 days)
- **Validation**: Based on regional financial crisis experience

**Lower Confidence Scenarios** (Tail Events):
- Market crashes >-40%
- Currency crisis or hyperinflation
- Systemic banking failure
- **Limitation**: Historical data insufficient for extreme tail events

### Scenario Probability Considerations

The stress testing framework does **not** assign probabilities to scenarios. Instead, it provides:
- **Deterministic outcomes**: "If X scenario occurs, portfolio impact is Y"
- **Historical context**: Comparison with past crisis events
- **Sensitivity analysis**: Impact of parameter variations

**For probability-based analysis**, IC should consider:
- Historical frequency of similar events
- Current economic environment and leading indicators
- Expert judgment and scenario planning exercises
- Integration with church's overall risk management framework
