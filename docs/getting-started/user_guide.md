# üìä Church Asset Risk Dashboard - User Guide for Investment Committee

*A practical guide for IC members to effectively use the stress testing dashboard*

---

## üéØ What This Dashboard Does

This dashboard helps the Investment Committee **simulate "what-if" scenarios** for our church's investment portfolio. Think of it as a **financial stress test** - like how banks test if they can survive economic downturns.

**Key Questions It Answers:**
- üí∞ How much would our portfolio be worth if markets crash?
- ‚è∞ How long would it take to access our money in a crisis?
- üõ°Ô∏è Do we have enough reserves to cover 12 months of church operations?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Which scenarios pose the biggest risks to our financial stability?

## üéõÔ∏è How to Run a Stress Test

### Step 1: Choose Your Scenario
**In the left sidebar, you'll see "Quick Scenarios":**

- **Conservative**: Mild economic slowdown
- **Moderate Stress**: Significant market correction
- **Severe Crisis**: Major financial crisis
- **2008 Financial Crisis**: Replicates the 2008 global crisis
- **COVID-19 Scenario**: Replicates the 2020 pandemic impact
- **Custom**: Create your own scenario

**üí° Tip**: Start with "Conservative" to get familiar, then try "Severe Crisis" to see worst-case impacts.

### Step 2: Understand the Controls
Each slider in the sidebar represents a different risk factor:

#### **Interest Rate Shock**
- **What it means**: Change in bank deposit and money market rates
- **Example**: -1.5% means rates drop by 1.5 percentage points
- **Impact**: Lower returns on our fixed deposits and money market funds

#### **Inflation Spike** 
- **What it means**: How much prices rise annually
- **Example**: 6% means everything costs 6% more each year
- **Impact**: Reduces the "real" purchasing power of our money

#### **Multi-Asset Fund Drawdown**
- **What it means**: How much our balanced funds lose value
- **Example**: -25% means our multi-asset funds lose a quarter of their value
- **Impact**: Directly reduces portfolio value

#### **Redemption Freeze**
- **What it means**: Extra days needed to withdraw money from funds
- **Example**: +15 days means it takes 15 days longer to access fund money
- **Impact**: Delays our ability to access cash when needed

#### **Early Withdrawal Penalty**
- **What it means**: Cost of breaking fixed deposits early
- **Example**: -2% means we lose 2% if we break FDs before maturity
- **Impact**: Reduces available cash in emergencies

#### **Counterparty Risk**
- **What it means**: Risk that banks or fund managers fail
- **Example**: 5% means we could lose 5% due to institution failures
- **Impact**: Direct loss of portfolio value

### Step 3: Read the Results
After adjusting sliders, the dashboard immediately shows:
