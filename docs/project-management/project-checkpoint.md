## üöÄ Latest Major Implementation: Enhanced Historical Data System (July 28, 2025)

### **Problem Addressed**
Previously, only market indices had comprehensive historical data with computed risk metrics. Rates, currencies, and bonds were limited to daily current values, missing critical historical analysis capabilities for comprehensive risk assessment.

### **Implementation Overview**
Extended the sophisticated historical data structure from indices to all asset types, creating a unified data architecture with consistent JSON schemas and computed risk metrics across the entire system.

### **Technical Implementation Details**

#### **1. Enhanced Data Fetching Functions**
```python
# All asset types now support historical data collection
_fetch_singapore_rates_openbb(historical=True)
_fetch_currency_rates_openbb(historical=True) 
_fetch_bond_yields_openbb(historical=True)
```

#### **2. Unified JSON Data Structure**
```json
{
  "current_rates": {...},           // Current values
  "historical_data": {              // Complete historical arrays
    "dates": ["2024-01-01", "..."],
    "sora_rates": [0.025, "..."],
    "total_days": 408
  },
  "computed_metrics": {             // Risk analysis
    "volatility": 0.008,
    "1y_change": 0.015
  }
}
```

#### **3. Advanced Risk Metrics Implementation**
- **Currency**: Volatility (4.97%), exchange rate trends, min/max ranges
- **Interest Rates**: SORA/FD volatility, yield curve changes, rate cycle analysis  
- **Bonds**: Yield curve spreads, term structure volatility, duration risk
- **Consistency**: All metrics use 252-day annualization standard

#### **4. Backward Compatibility**
- **Asset Data Manager**: Handles both legacy (simple) and enhanced (historical) data formats
- **Validation Updates**: Support for new field names while maintaining old field compatibility
- **Dashboard Integration**: Seamless loading of enhanced data structures

### **Implementation Results**
- **‚úÖ Real Historical Data**: Successfully fetched 408 days of SGD/USD exchange rates from 2024-01-01
- **‚úÖ Computed Risk Metrics**: Currency volatility 4.97%, all rate trends calculated
- **‚úÖ Unified Structure**: All asset types now have consistent `historical_data` + `computed_metrics`
- **‚úÖ Start Date Fix**: `--start-date` parameter working correctly (was broken due to CLI argument mismatch)
- **‚úÖ GitHub Workflow**: Fixed YAML syntax issues and summary generation

### **Files Modified** (July 28, 2025)
- `utils/enhanced_data_sources.py`: Enhanced all asset fetch functions with historical data support
- `utils/asset_data_manager.py`: Updated save methods to handle new data structures
- `scripts/update_market_data.py`: Fixed start-date parameter bug and validation logic
- `.github/workflows/market-data-update.yml`: Fixed YAML syntax and Python escaping issues
- `docs/architecture/dataops-implementation.md`: Added complete JSON schema documentation

## üèóÔ∏è Current Production Architecture
