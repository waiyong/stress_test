# 📊 Investment Committee Demo Plan
## Church Asset Risk & Stress Testing Dashboard

**Meeting Date**: August 4, 2025  
**Duration**: 20-25 minutes  
**Presenter**: Technical Team  
**Audience**: CPC Investment Committee  

---

## 🎯 Demo Objectives & Presenter Preparation

### **Primary Goal**
"Today I'll show you how this dashboard gives our Investment Committee the same professional risk management tools that major institutions use - but tailored specifically for our church's needs."

### **Key Messages to Communicate**
1. **Professional Risk Management**: "We're moving from gut feelings to data-driven decisions"
2. **Business Assumption Validation**: "I need your expertise to confirm our assumptions about church finances"
3. **Real Market Integration**: "This uses live Singapore market data - the same sources that banks use"
4. **Scenario Planning**: "We can test 'what if' scenarios before they actually happen"

### **Expected Outcomes**
- ✅ Get IC validation on annual OPEX (currently set at SGD 2.4M)
- ✅ Decide on reserve policy (we're using 12 months vs industry standard 3-6 months)
- ✅ Get approval to deploy with confirmed parameters
- ✅ Establish regular stress testing schedule for IC meetings

### **🎯 Presenter Confidence Builder**
**Remember**: You're not expected to be a finance expert - you're the technical expert showing them a powerful tool. When they ask detailed financial questions, leverage their expertise: "That's exactly the kind of institutional knowledge I was hoping you could provide."

## 📋 Demo Structure (20-25 minutes)

### **1. Opening Context (3 minutes)**

#### **Hook Statement & Speaking Notes**
**Start with**: "Let me paint you a picture. It's March 2020. COVID has just hit. Markets are crashing 30% in weeks. As the Investment Committee, you need to answer some critical questions: Can we keep the church running? Do we have enough reserves? Should we sell investments or hold on? This dashboard is designed to answer exactly those questions - with real data, not guesswork."

**📊 Financial Context for Presenter**: 
- During COVID-19, Singapore's STI index fell 34% from peak to trough
- Many churches faced 20-40% donation drops while maintaining full operations
- Churches with proper stress testing survived; others had to make painful cuts

#### **Current Challenge** (Use conversational tone)
**Say**: "Right now, when we make investment decisions, we're essentially flying blind. We have our SGD 3.4M portfolio, but honestly - how do we really know if it can weather a financial storm? Most of our decisions are based on experience and intuition, which is valuable, but in today's volatile markets, we need something more robust."

**💡 Presenter Note**: If asked about current decision-making process, acknowledge it's been working but emphasize evolving market complexity.

#### **Our Solution** (Position as partnership)
**Say**: "What I've built is essentially a professional risk management system - the same type of tools that major investment committees use - but customized for our church's specific needs. It integrates live Singapore market data and lets us test 'what if' scenarios before they actually happen."

**🎯 Transition**: "Let me show you exactly how this works, starting with where we are today."

---

### **2. Portfolio Overview Demo (4 minutes)**

#### **Opening Statement**
**Say**: "So here's our starting point - our current SGD 3.4M portfolio. I've loaded the actual numbers, and what you see here is not just where our money is, but how it's strategically allocated for both stability and growth."

#### **Current Portfolio Walk-Through** (Point to screen as you speak)
**Say**: "Looking at our allocation, we've got a pretty conservative approach - and for good reason:"

- **Time Deposits: SGD 1.3M (38%)** - "This is our bedrock. Fixed rate, guaranteed returns, but locked up for 6-12 months."
- **Money Market Funds: SGD 1.0M (29%)** - "Our liquid safety net. We can access this in 1-2 days if needed."
- **Multi-Asset Funds: SGD 550K (16%)** - "This is where we get growth. More volatile, but historically this is what keeps pace with inflation."
- **Bond Funds: SGD 350K (10%)** - "Steady income, more stable than stocks, but not as safe as deposits."
- **Cash: SGD 200K (7%)** - "Emergency buffer - available immediately."

**💰 Financial Context for Presenter**:
- This allocation is actually quite conservative compared to many churches
- 67% in ultra-safe assets (deposits + MMF) vs typical 40-50%
- Growth allocation (16%) is below typical 20-30% for churches our size

#### **Liquidity Analysis** (Click to show liquidity breakdown)
**Say**: "Now here's something really important - it's not just about how much money we have, but how quickly we can get to it in a crisis. Let me show you our liquidity profile."

**Point to each category**: 
- **Immediate access (0 days): SGD 200K** - "True emergency funds"
- **Very fast (1-3 days): SGD 1M** - "For urgent operational needs"  
- **Moderate (5-30 days): SGD 900K** - "For planned expenses or market opportunities"
- **Longer term (180+ days): SGD 1.3M** - "Locked until maturity, but highest returns"

**🎯 Key Message**: "This tells us that in a true emergency, we can access SGD 1.2M within 3 days, and SGD 2.1M within a month. That's pretty solid liquidity management."

**🎯 Transition**: "But here's the big question - what happens to these numbers when markets get stressed? That's where our real-time data comes in."

---

### **3. Real Market Data Integration (3 minutes)**

#### **Opening Statement**
**Say**: "Now, what makes this system powerful is that it's not working with outdated numbers or assumptions. Everything you see here is based on live Singapore market data - the same sources that banks and investment firms use."

#### **Live Data Demonstration** (Point to current data on screen)
**Say**: "Let me show you what's happening in markets right now:"

- **Singapore Interest Rates**: "SORA is currently at 2.34% - that's the rate our MMF tracks. Fixed deposit rates are averaging 3.10%, which affects our largest holding."
- **Singapore Stock Market**: "The STI is trading at [current price] - this tells us how our multi-asset funds might perform."
- **Global Markets**: "We're also tracking MSCI World and Asia indices because our multi-asset funds have international exposure."

**📊 Financial Context for Presenter**:
- SORA = Singapore Overnight Rate Average (like the Fed Funds rate in US)
- STI = Singapore's main stock index (like S&P 500 for Singapore)
- These rates directly impact our portfolio values in real-time

#### **Historical Context** (Build credibility)
**Say**: "What's really valuable is that this system has been tracking 7+ years of Singapore market data, including the COVID crash in 2020. So when we run stress tests, we're not guessing - we're using actual historical patterns."

#### **System Reliability** (Address potential concerns)
**Say**: "Now, I know some of you might be thinking, 'What if the data feed fails?' We've built in multiple backups. If live data isn't available, it automatically falls back to our cached data, and if all else fails, it uses conservative estimates. The system always works."

**💡 Presenter Safety Net**: If asked about technical details, say: "The technical team has set up what they call a 'triple fallback system.' I can get you the exact technical specifications, but the key point is reliability - this system won't leave us without data."

**🎯 Transition**: "So now that you can see we're working with real, current market conditions, let me show you how we use this data to measure our risk."

---

### **4. Risk Metrics Deep Dive (8 minutes)**

#### **Introduction to Risk Measurement**
**Say**: "Alright, this is where we get to the heart of risk management. I'm going to show you three key metrics that professional investment committees use to measure financial risk. Think of these as our financial health dashboard."

**Click to Risk Metrics tab**

**Say**: "You'll see three gauges here, each measuring a different aspect of our financial safety. Let me walk you through each one and what they mean for our church."

##### **A. Maximum Drawdown (%)** - "How bad could it get?"

**Say**: "This first gauge answers the question: 'In a crisis, how much could our portfolio lose?' It's measuring the worst-case scenario decline in our total portfolio value."

**Point to the gauge**: "Right now it's showing [X]%. What this means is that under the current stress scenario, our portfolio would decline by [X]% from SGD 3.4M to SGD [Y]M."

**Explain the color coding**: 
- **Green (under 20%)**: "We're in good shape. A decline under 20% is considered manageable for most institutions."
- **Red (over 20%)**: "This is our warning zone. Over 20% decline means we need to consider our options carefully."

**📊 Financial Context for Presenter**:
- 20% is a standard institutional risk threshold
- During 2008 crisis, many portfolios lost 30-50%
- Churches typically can handle 15-25% declines without operational impact

**Explain the delta number**: "That [+/-X] number tells you how far we are from the 20% danger threshold. If it's negative, we're better than the threshold; positive means we're exceeding it."

##### **B. Reserve Coverage (%)** - "Can we keep the lights on?"

**Say**: "This second gauge is probably our most important metric. It answers: 'After a crisis hits, can we still operate the church?' It compares our stressed portfolio value to our annual operating expenses."

**Point to the calculation**: "We've set our annual operational expenses at SGD 2.4M - and I'll need your input on whether that's accurate. The gauge shows [X]%, which means we'd have [Y] months of operating expenses covered even after the crisis."

**Explain the target**: "We've set 100% as our minimum - that's 12 months of coverage. Industry standard for churches is actually 3-6 months, so we're being quite conservative."

**💰 Financial Context for Presenter**:
- 12 months reserve = very conservative (most churches aim for 3-6 months)
- SGD 2.4M annual OPEX needs IC validation
- This metric directly ties to church operational continuity

**Critical validation moment**: "I really need your expertise here - is SGD 2.4M realistic for our annual operating expenses? This number drives everything else."

##### **C. Liquidity Time (Days)** - "How fast can we get our money?"

**Say**: "This third gauge tells us: 'In a crisis, how long would it take to access our funds?' It's not just about having money - it's about being able to get to it when we need it."

**Explain the calculation simply**: "The system looks at each chunk of our portfolio and how long it takes to access, then calculates a weighted average. Cash is immediate, MMF takes 1-2 days, but time deposits are locked up for months."

**Point to the result**: "We're showing [X] days, which means on average, it would take [X] days to access our portfolio during a crisis."

**Explain the threshold**: "We've set 90 days as our comfort zone. That gives us a full quarter to navigate any crisis without having to make hasty decisions."

**🎯 Key Message**: "These three metrics together give us a complete picture: How much we might lose, whether we can keep operating, and how quickly we can access funds. It's like having a financial early warning system."

#### **Interactive Scenario Testing** (4 minutes)
**Say**: "Now here's where this gets really powerful. Instead of wondering 'what if', we can actually test different crisis scenarios and see exactly how we'd fare. I've set up three scenarios based on real historical events."

##### **Scenario A: Conservative Stress Test** (1 minute)
**Say**: "Let me start with a mild stress scenario - think economic slowdown, not full crisis."

**Click "Conservative" preset and explain while it loads**:
"I'm applying a small interest rate cut, a 15% market decline - basically a standard market correction - and a brief 5-day redemption freeze."

**Point to results as they appear**:
- **Max Drawdown**: "Look at this - only about 3% portfolio decline. Well within our comfort zone."
- **Reserve Coverage**: "We're still at 117% - that's over 14 months of operating expenses."
- **Liquidity Time**: "45 days to access funds - no problem at all."

**Key message**: "In a typical economic slowdown, we're absolutely fine. Our conservative portfolio strategy pays off."

##### **Scenario B: COVID-19 Stress Test** (1.5 minutes)
**Say**: "Now let's test something we actually lived through - the COVID-19 market crash of March 2020."

**Click "COVID-19 Scenario" and provide context**:
"This replicates what actually happened - markets fell 33%, central banks cut rates aggressively, and there were redemption delays as everyone tried to get to cash at once."

**Point to results with historical context**:
- **Max Drawdown**: "17% decline - significant, but notice we're still under our 20% danger threshold."
- **Reserve Coverage**: "108% - we'd still have over a year of operating expenses covered."
- **Liquidity Time**: "65 days - a bit longer, but still manageable."

**Historical validation**: "What's reassuring is that churches with portfolios like ours did survive COVID-19 without major operational cuts. This model is telling us we would have been fine."

##### **Scenario C: 2008 Financial Crisis** (1.5 minutes)
**Say**: "Now let's test the worst-case scenario - a 2008-style financial crisis. This is as bad as it gets in modern financial history."

**Click "2008 Financial Crisis" with serious tone**:
"Market crash of 37%, severe liquidity freeze as banks stopped lending to each other, extended redemption delays. This is the stress test of stress tests."

**Point to results with appropriate concern**:
- **Max Drawdown**: "22% decline - notice this crosses our 20% danger threshold into the red zone."
- **Reserve Coverage**: "102% - we're still above our minimum, but barely. Just over 12 months of reserves."
- **Liquidity Time**: "85 days - approaching our 90-day comfort limit."

**Critical interpretation**: "Even in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, we survive - but with very little margin for error. This tells us our current allocation is appropriate, but we need to be prepared for some tough decisions in extreme scenarios."

**🎯 Key Takeaway**: "What this shows us is that our conservative approach works. We weather normal downturns easily, survive major crises adequately, but extreme events push us to our limits - which is exactly what a good risk management system should tell us."

### **5. Portfolio Composition Analysis (3 minutes)**

#### **Understanding Post-Crisis Portfolio Balance**
**Say**: "Now here's something really interesting that most people don't think about. When a crisis hits, your portfolio doesn't just shrink - it actually changes shape. Let me show you what I mean."

**Click to show "Portfolio Composition (Post-Stress)"**

**Say**: "This chart shows how our asset allocation would look AFTER a crisis hits. Notice how the percentages shift?"

#### **Walk Through the Changes** (Point to before/after comparison)
**Say**: "Let's look at what happens to our portfolio balance:"

- **Time Deposits**: "Started at 38%, now they're 42% of our portfolio. They didn't grow - everything else shrunk more."
- **Multi-Asset Funds**: "These dropped from 16% to about 11% because they take the biggest hit in market crashes."
- **Money Market Funds**: "Actually hold their ground pretty well, maybe even grow as a percentage."

**💡 Financial Context for Presenter**:
- This is called "portfolio drift" - asset allocations change during stress
- Conservative assets become larger % of total (they fall less)
- Growth assets become smaller % of total (they fall more)
- This is normal and expected behavior

#### **Strategic Implications** (Make it practical)
**Say**: "Why does this matter for our investment decisions? Several reasons:"

1. **Rebalancing Opportunities**: "After a crisis, we might want to rebalance - sell some of the conservative assets that held up and buy more growth assets while they're cheap."

2. **Risk Profile Changes**: "Our risk profile actually becomes MORE conservative after a crisis, which might not be what we want long-term."

3. **Liquidity Planning**: "We can see exactly which assets we'd still have access to and plan our cash flow accordingly."

4. **Asset Allocation Strategy**: "This helps us decide if our current allocation is right, or if we should adjust to prepare for the next cycle."

**🎯 Key Business Message**: "This analysis helps us think beyond just 'how much money do we lose' to 'how does our entire investment strategy change' - which is crucial for long-term planning."

**🎯 Transition**: "Now, all of this analysis is only as good as the assumptions we're using. And that's where I really need your expertise."

---

### **6. Business Assumption Validation (4 minutes)**

#### **Critical Conversation - Need Your Expertise**
**Say**: "Alright, this is where I really need your financial expertise. The system is only as good as the assumptions we put into it, and I need your validation on two critical numbers that drive everything we've just seen."

##### **Annual Operating Expenses - SGD 2.4M** ⚠️ **CRITICAL VALIDATION NEEDED**

**Say**: "First, let's talk about our annual operating expenses. I've set this at SGD 2.4 million, but honestly, I need you to tell me if that's accurate."

**Ask directly**: "Is SGD 2.4M realistic for our actual annual operating expenses? Should we be using last year's actuals, this year's budget, or maybe a 3-year average to smooth out any unusual years?"

**Also ask**: "Are we talking about pure operational costs - staff, utilities, programs - or should we include capital expenditures like major repairs and equipment?"

**Demonstrate the impact**: "Let me show you why this matters so much. Watch what happens when I change this number..."

**Adjust OPEX slider and show impact**: 
- "At SGD 2.0M, all our scenarios show 'excess reserves' - we look very safe"
- "At SGD 2.8M, some scenarios drop to 'borderline adequacy' - much more concerning"

**Key point**: "This one number completely changes our risk profile, so getting it right is absolutely critical."

##### **Reserve Coverage Policy - 12 Months vs Industry Standard** ⚠️ **STRATEGIC DECISION NEEDED**

**Say**: "The second big assumption is our reserve requirement. I've set it at 12 months of coverage, but I learned that industry standard for churches is actually 3-6 months."

**Present the trade-off fairly**: "Here's the question: Do we want to be conservative with 12 months, or align with industry standards at 6 months? Let me show you the difference."

**Demonstrate with current scenario**: 
- "With 6-month requirement: We show 'excess reserves' in almost all scenarios - gives us more investment flexibility"
- "With 12-month requirement: We're 'adequate' but closer to the line - more conservative but less upside"

**Ask for guidance**: "What's our risk tolerance as a church? Are we naturally conservative and want that 12-month buffer, or should we be more efficient with our capital?"

**Also consider**: "How does this align with any existing board policies? I don't want to create a system that conflicts with decisions you've already made."

#### **Decision Process** (Make it collaborative)
**Say**: "Here's what I suggest: Let's get consensus on these two numbers right now, then I'll update the system and we can re-run all our scenarios with the validated assumptions. That way, everything we deploy will be based on your actual financial expertise, not my best guesses."

**Facilitation approach**:
1. "Let's start with the OPEX number - what's our best estimate?"
2. "Now the reserve policy - 6, 9, or 12 months?"
3. "I'll update these settings and show you how it changes our results"
4. "Then we document this for the board and audit trail"

**🎯 Transition**: "Once we have these numbers locked in, let me show you how we can document and share all this analysis."

---

### **7. Professional Documentation & Reporting (2 minutes)**

#### **Generating Professional Reports**
**Say**: "Finally, let me show you how we document all this analysis. Because at the end of the day, we need to create a paper trail for board reporting, audit compliance, and our own records."

**Click to generate PDF report**

**Say**: "With one click, the system generates a comprehensive PDF report with a timestamp - so we know exactly when this analysis was done and what assumptions we used."

#### **Report Contents** (Show PDF preview if possible)
**Say**: "The report includes everything we've just reviewed:"

- **Executive Summary**: "Key findings and recommendations in business language"
- **Portfolio Analysis**: "Current allocation and post-stress composition"  
- **Risk Metrics**: "All three gauges with color-coded alerts and explanations"
- **Scenario Details**: "Exactly what parameters we tested and why"
- **Business Assumptions**: "The OPEX and reserve numbers we validated today"
- **Recommendations**: "Any suggested actions based on the results"

**Show the filename**: "Notice it's timestamped - 'CPC_StressTest_2025-08-04_14-30.pdf' - so we can track our analysis over time."

#### **Business Applications** (Make it practical)
**Say**: "This isn't just nice-to-have documentation. We can use these reports for:"

1. **IC Meeting Records**: "Include the PDF in our meeting minutes to show we're doing proper risk analysis"
2. **Board Reporting**: "When we present to the board, we have professional documentation of our risk management"
3. **Audit Documentation**: "Our auditors will love seeing systematic risk analysis"
4. **Trend Analysis**: "Over time, we can compare reports to see how our risk profile evolves"

**🎯 Key Value**: "This transforms us from a church that manages money intuitively to one that manages money professionally - with the documentation to prove it."

**🎯 Wrap-up Transition**: "So that's the complete system. We've got real-time data, professional risk analysis, scenario testing, and audit-ready documentation. Let me summarize where we go from here."

## 🎯 Next Steps & Implementation Plan

### **Immediate Actions** (This Week)
**Say**: "Based on today's session, here's what happens next:"

1. **Finalize Business Assumptions**: "I'll update the system with the OPEX and reserve numbers we agreed on today"
2. **Deploy Production System**: "Once the numbers are locked in, we'll deploy this to production so all IC members can access it"
3. **Schedule Training**: "I'd like to schedule a follow-up session to train everyone on using the system independently"

### **Ongoing Implementation** (Next Month)
**Say**: "Looking ahead, I suggest we:"

1. **Establish Regular Testing**: "Maybe run stress tests monthly or quarterly - you tell me what frequency makes sense"
2. **Board Integration**: "Present this system and our findings to the board for their approval and oversight"
3. **Policy Documentation**: "Update our investment policy to include systematic stress testing"
4. **Audit Preparation**: "Start building a library of reports for our annual audit"

### **Questions for IC Decision**
**Ask directly**:
- "How often should we run these stress tests - monthly, quarterly, or as-needed?"
- "Who should have access to the system besides IC members?"
- "How do we want to present this to the board?"
- "What other scenarios would be valuable to test?"
