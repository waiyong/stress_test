---

## üéØ Demo Objectives

### **Primary Goal**
Demonstrate how the dashboard empowers the Investment Committee with data-driven risk assessment for church portfolio management.

### **Key Messages**

4. **Scenario Planning**: Test portfolio resilience against historical and hypothetical crises

### **Expected Outcomes**
- ‚úÖ Validate annual OPEX assumptions (SGD 2.4M vs actual expenses)
- ‚úÖ Decide on reserve coverage requirement (12 vs 3-6 months industry standard)
- ‚úÖ Approve deployment with confirmed business parameters
- ‚úÖ Establish regular stress testing process for IC meetings

#### **Current Challenge**
- How do we know if our SGD 3.4M portfolio can weather financial storms?
- Investment decisions currently based on intuition rather than data
- Need professional risk management tools for fiduciary responsibility

#### **Our Solution**
- Real-time dashboard with Singapore market data integration
- Professional-grade stress testing used by major investment committees
- Data-driven insights for informed decision making

### **4. Risk Metrics Deep Dive (8 minutes)**

#### **Understanding the Risk Metrics Tab (4 minutes)**

Navigate to **Risk Metrics tab** and explain the three key gauges:

##### **A. Maximum Drawdown (%)**
- **What it means**: "How much would our portfolio value drop in this crisis?"
- **Calculation**: (Original Value - Stressed Value) / Original Value
- **Example**: If portfolio drops from SGD 3.4M to SGD 3.3M = 3% drawdown
- **Color coding**: 
  - ‚úÖ **Green**: Less than 20% decline (safe)
  - üî¥ **Red**: More than 20% decline (significant risk)
- **Understanding the delta**: "3% with red arrow -17" means:
  - Portfolio declined 3%
  - This is 17 percentage points BETTER than the 20% danger threshold
  - Red arrow = favorable direction (lower decline is better)

##### **B. Reserve Coverage (%)**
- **What it means**: "After crisis, can we still cover church operations?"
- **Calculation**: Stressed Portfolio Value √∑ Annual OPEX (SGD 2.4M)
- **Target**: 100% = 12 months coverage minimum
- **Example**: 117% = 14.4 months of reserves after stress
- **Color coding**:
  - ‚úÖ **Green**: Above 100% (adequate reserves)
  - üî¥ **Red**: Below 100% (insufficient reserves)

##### **C. Liquidity Time (Days)**
- **What it means**: "How long to access our money during crisis?"
- **Calculation**: Weighted average based on asset amounts and access times
- **Example calculation**:
  ```
  Cash (SGD 200K √ó 0 days) + MMF (SGD 1M √ó 1 day) + 
  Bonds (SGD 350K √ó 5 days) + Multi-Asset (SGD 550K √ó 30 days) + 
  Time Deposits (SGD 1.3M √ó 180 days) + Crisis delays
  = ~45-75 days average access time
  ```
- **Threshold**: 
  - ‚úÖ **Green**: Less than 90 days (adequate liquidity)
  - üî¥ **Red**: More than 90 days (liquidity concern)

#### **Interactive Risk Testing (4 minutes)**

##### **Scenario A: Conservative Stress** (1 minute)
- **Select**: "Conservative" preset scenario
- **Parameters**: Interest rate cut -0.5%, market drop -15%, 5-day redemption freeze
- **Expected Results**:
  - Max Drawdown: ~3% (very mild impact)
  - Reserve Coverage: ~117% (strong position - 14.4 months reserves)
  - Liquidity Time: ~45 days (adequate access)
- **Message**: *"We easily weather mild economic slowdowns with strong reserves."*

##### **Scenario B: COVID-19 Stress** (1.5 minutes)
- **Select**: "COVID-19 Scenario" preset
- **Parameters**: Market drop -33%, interest rate cut -1.5%, 14-day redemption freeze
- **Expected Results**:
  - Max Drawdown: ~17% (significant but manageable)
  - Reserve Coverage: ~108% (still above 12-month requirement)
  - Liquidity Time: ~65 days (reasonable access time)
- **Message**: *"We would have survived COVID-19 with adequate reserves to spare."*

##### **Scenario C: 2008 Financial Crisis** (1.5 minutes)
- **Select**: "2008 Financial Crisis" preset
- **Parameters**: Market drop -37%, severe liquidity freeze 21 days
- **Expected Results**:
  - Max Drawdown: ~22% (crosses 20% danger threshold - red flag)
  - Reserve Coverage: ~102% (barely above 12-month requirement)
  - Liquidity Time: ~85 days (approaching 90-day concern level)
- **Message**: *"Even in the worst historical crisis, we maintain minimum reserves, but with little margin for error."*

---

### **5. Portfolio Composition Analysis (3 minutes)**

#### **Understanding "Portfolio Composition (Post-Stress)"**
- **What it shows**: Asset allocation AFTER stress factors are applied
- **Key insight**: Shows how portfolio balance shifts under pressure
- **Example**: 
  - **Before stress**: Time deposits 38%, Multi-Asset 16%
  - **After crisis**: Time deposits 42%, Multi-Asset 11% (conservative assets become larger percentage)

#### **Strategic Value**
1. **Risk Assessment**: See which assets provide stability vs growth
2. **Rebalancing Signals**: Identify if stressed portfolio becomes too concentrated
3. **Asset Allocation Planning**: Understand true diversification during crisis
4. **Liquidity Profile**: Shows actual accessible funds after crisis impact

#### **Business Message**
*"This tells us how our investment mix would actually look after a crisis hits, helping us plan our asset allocation strategy."*

---

### **6. Business Assumption Validation (4 minutes)**

#### **Critical Discussion Points**

##### **Annual OPEX Assumption** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES IC VALIDATION**
- **Current Setting**: SGD 2.4M
- **Key Questions**:
  - "Is SGD 2.4M accurate for our church's actual annual operating expenses?"
  - "Should we use last year's actuals, this year's budget, or a 3-year average?"
  - "Do we include capital expenses or just operational costs?"
- **Impact Demonstration**: 
  - Change OPEX setting and show how all reserve coverage metrics update
  - Show difference between SGD 2.0M vs SGD 2.8M OPEX assumptions

##### **Reserve Requirement Policy** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRES IC DECISION**
- **Current Setting**: 12 months coverage required
- **Industry Context**: Standard church/nonprofit practice is 3-6 months
- **Key Questions**:
  - "Should we align with industry standard (3-6 months) or maintain conservative 12-month policy?"
  - "What's our risk tolerance for reserve adequacy?"
  - "How does this align with our board-approved financial policies?"
- **Impact Demonstration**:
  - Show scenarios with 6-month vs 12-month requirements
  - 6-month target: Most scenarios show "excess reserves"
  - 12-month target: Some scenarios show "borderline adequacy"

#### **Validation Process**
1. **Record IC decisions** on OPEX amount and reserve months
2. **Update system settings** with confirmed parameters
3. **Re-run stress tests** with validated assumptions
4. **Document decisions** for board reporting and audit trail

## üìä Risk Metrics Reference Card

### **Maximum Drawdown Interpretation**
- **Value Display**: Percentage portfolio decline under stress
- **Delta Indicator**: Difference from 20% danger threshold
- **Example**: "3% with -17 delta" means:
  - Portfolio declined by 3%
  - This is 17 percentage points BETTER than 20% threshold
  - Red arrow pointing down = favorable (lower decline is better)
- **Color Coding**: Green bar if <20%, Red bar if >20%

### **Reserve Coverage Interpretation**
- **Value Display**: Percentage of required reserve coverage
- **Delta Indicator**: Difference from 100% minimum requirement
- **Example**: "117% with +17 delta" means:
  - 117% of required reserves maintained
  - This is 17 percentage points ABOVE 100% minimum
  - Equals 14.4 months of coverage (12 √ó 1.17)
- **Color Coding**: Green bar if >100%, Red bar if <100%

### **Liquidity Time Interpretation**
- **Value Display**: Weighted average days to access portfolio funds
- **Delta Indicator**: Difference from 90-day threshold
- **Example**: "45 days with -45 delta" means:
  - 45 days average access time
  - This is 45 days BETTER than 90-day threshold
  - Green arrow = favorable (faster access is better)
- **Color Coding**: Green bar if <90 days, Red bar if >90 days
